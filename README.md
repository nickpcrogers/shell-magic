# shell-magic
Some small single-purpose (sometimes very specific) scripts I might want later.

## bitcheck.py
`bitcheck.py 0x5`

`bitcheck.py 4 2 1`

Given a hex value, determine which bits are high (e.g. 0x5 -> 2,0). Given a list of bits, do the reverse.

## hfind.sh
`hfind.sh some_header.h`

A neat string of piped header shell commands to find a c(++) header in your system. I didn't write this but I have since lost the source (some random StackOverflow post).

## ipfind.py
`sudo ipfind`

Find available IPs in a subnet. Depends on arp-scan.

## trac2svn.rb
A glorified single-purpose regex substitution
