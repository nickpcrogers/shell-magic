# shell-magic
Some small single-purpose (sometimes very specific) scripts I might want later.

## bitcheck.py
Given a hex value, determine which bits are high (e.g. 0x5 -> 2,0). Given a list of bits, do the reverse.

## hfind.sh
A neat string of piped header shell commands to find a c(++) header in your system. I didn't write this but I have since lost the source (some random StackOverflow post).

## ipfind.py
Find available IPs in a subnet.

## trac2svn.rb
Strip trac markers from an url and replace them with svn ones so you can pipe directly to svn co.
